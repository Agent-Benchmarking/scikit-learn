# Documentation Enhancement Strategy

This directory was created to store patch files for adding example links to scikit-learn docstrings. After experimentation, we discovered several challenges with the patch approach for documentation updates.

## Challenges with Patch Files

While patches seemed like a promising solution for timeout issues encountered when editing large files, we discovered several limitations:

1. **Formatting issues**: Patches need extremely precise context lines, making them brittle when applied
2. **Syntax errors**: Even with fuzzy matching, patches can insert content at incorrect positions, causing Python syntax errors 
3. **Maintainability**: The patch process adds complexity to the documentation workflow

## Recommended Alternative Approaches

For classes in large files where direct edits cause timeout issues, we recommend the following alternatives:

1. **Command-line editing tools**: Use `sed`, `awk`, or similar tools to make targeted changes:
   ```bash
   # Example: Add example links to ElasticNet docstring
   sed -i '/ElasticNet.*predict(\[\[0, 0\]\])/a\\\n    .. topic:: Examples:\\\n\\\n        - :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_linear_model_plot_lasso_and_elasticnet.py`\\\n        - :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_linear_model_plot_elastic_net_precomputed_gram_matrix_with_weighted_samples.py`\\\n        - :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_inspection_plot_train_error_vs_test_error.py`' sklearn/linear_model/_coordinate_descent.py
   ```

2. **Split changes into minimal edits**: Focus on one very specific section at a time:
   - Target only one class per edit
   - Minimize the amount of context required in your edits
   - Test changes on small sections before applying to larger files

3. **Python scripting**: Create a Python script that reads a file, makes targeted modifications, and writes it back:
   ```python
   def add_example_links(file_path, class_name, example_links, context_line):
       with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
           content = f.read()
       
       # Find docstring location based on context line
       insert_index = content.find(context_line) + len(context_line)
       
       # Create example links block
       links_block = "\n\n    .. topic:: Examples:\n\n"
       for link in example_links:
           links_block += f"        - :ref:`{link}`\n"
       
       # Insert links block
       new_content = content[:insert_index] + links_block + content[insert_index:]
       
       # Write back to file
       with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
           f.write(new_content)
   ```

## Progress Tracking

Documentation progress is tracked in `linear_model_links_progress.md`. For classes in large files, consider using one of the alternative approaches mentioned above.

## Conclusion

After attempting the patch approach, we found it's not well-suited for documentation updates in this codebase. The alternative methods suggested above provide more reliable ways to make docstring enhancements while avoiding timeout issues.
