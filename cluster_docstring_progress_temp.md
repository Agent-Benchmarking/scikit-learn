# Clustering Algorithms Documentation Enhancement Progress

## Status Summary (2025-03-18)

| Algorithm | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| KMeans | ✅ Done | Added multiple example links for initialization strategies, optimal n_clusters, etc. |
| DBSCAN | ✅ Done | Added link to HDBSCAN example for comparison |
| Agglomerative Clustering | ✅ Done | Added links to examples demonstrating metrics effects on hierarchical clustering |
| Birch | ✅ Done | Added relevant example links |
| OPTICS | ✅ Done | Added example links from plot_optics.py and plot_cluster_comparison.py |
| Mean Shift | ✅ Already Had Links | Confirmed existing documentation was sufficient |
| Spectral Clustering | ✅ Already Had Links | Confirmed existing documentation was sufficient |
| Affinity Propagation | ✅ Already Had Links | Confirmed existing documentation was sufficient |
| MiniBatchKMeans | ✅ Already Had Links | Confirmed existing documentation was sufficient |
| BisectingKMeans | ✅ Already Had Links | Confirmed existing documentation has link to comparison example |
| HDBSCAN | ✅ Already Had Links | Comprehensive documentation with See Also section and examples |

## Next Steps
- Review any remaining clustering algorithms not listed above
- Ensure consistent formatting across all docstrings
- Verify that all example links are valid and useful for users
