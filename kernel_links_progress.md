# Gaussian Process Kernel Example Links Progress

## Completed
- [x] RBF kernel - Added links to plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py and plot_gpr_noisy.py
- [x] ConstantKernel - Already had link to plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py
- [x] WhiteKernel - Already had link to plot_gpr_noisy.py
- [x] RationalQuadratic kernel - Added link to plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py
- [x] ExpSineSquared kernel - Added link to plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py
- [x] Sum kernel - Added link to plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py
- [x] Product kernel - Already had link to plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py
- [x] DotProduct kernel - Already had link to plot_gpr_noisy.py
- [x] PairwiseKernel - Added link to plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py
- [x] Matern kernel - Already had link to plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py
- [x] Exponentiation kernel - Already had link to plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py

## To Do
- [ ] ConstantKernel (as scaling factor) - Check if additional examples needed
- [ ] Other kernel combinations - Check if additional examples needed
- [ ] Check for any other kernel combinations that may need example links

## Notes
- There may be formatting issues with some kernel formulas in the docstrings that need to be fixed separately.
- We should review all links for consistency in wording and relevance.
