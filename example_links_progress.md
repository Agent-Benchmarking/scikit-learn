# Scikit-learn Documentation Example Links Progress

This document tracks progress on adding example links to scikit-learn documentation as part of issue #30621.

## Completed Modules
- [x] gaussian_process.kernels - All kernel classes have been linked to appropriate examples
- [x] kernel_approximation - Added links where appropriate examples exist (PolynomialCountSketch and RBFSampler)
- [x] cluster - All clustering classes have example links added where appropriate
- [x] decomposition - Added example links for NMF, MiniBatchNMF, and LatentDirichletAllocation
- [x] ensemble - Added example links for all ensemble classes including StackingRegressor, VotingClassifier, and VotingRegressor
- [x] linear_model - Added example links for MultiTaskLassoCV, MultiTaskElasticNet, MultiTaskElasticNetCV, RidgeClassifierCV, and PassiveAggressiveRegressor
- [x] svm - Added example links for SVC, LinearSVC, SVR, and OneClassSVM
- [x] neighbors - Added example links for all neighbors classes including KNeighborsClassifier, NearestNeighbors, LocalOutlierFactor, and KernelDensity
- [x] feature_extraction - Added example links for text vectorizers (HashingVectorizer, CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer), DictVectorizer, and FeatureHasher
- [x] model_selection - Added example links for all cross-validation classes, search methods, and metrics/validation functions

## In Progress
- [ ] preprocessing - Added example links for all scaler classes (MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, etc.), TargetEncoder, and KBinsDiscretizer
- [ ] manifold
- [ ] mixture
- [ ] etc.

## To Do
- [ ] preprocessing
- [ ] manifold
- [ ] mixture
- [ ] etc.

## Notes
- Create a detailed tracking file for each module being worked on
- Add one example reference at a time to avoid edit conflicts
- Check relevance of examples before adding links
