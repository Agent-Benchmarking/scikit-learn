## Kernel Classes and Their Example Links

### Completed
- [x] **RBF kernel**
  - Added links to `plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py` and `plot_gpr_noisy.py`
  - This shows basic GP functionality and how the RBF kernel behaves

- [x] **ConstantKernel**
  - Already had link to `plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py`
  - Used as both a bias term and as a scaling factor in kernel combinations

- [x] **WhiteKernel**
  - Already had link to `plot_gpr_noisy.py`
  - Shows how the kernel estimates noise levels

- [x] **RationalQuadratic kernel**
  - Added link to `plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py`
  - Shows how this kernel behaves in a GP

- [x] **ExpSineSquared kernel**
  - Added link to `plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py`
  - Shows how this kernel models periodic functions

- [x] **Sum kernel**
  - Added link to `plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py`
  - Shows how to combine kernels through addition

- [x] **Product kernel**
  - Already had link to `plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py`
  - Shows how to combine kernels through multiplication

- [x] **DotProduct kernel**
  - Already had link to `plot_gpr_noisy.py`
  - Shows usage in a GP context

- [x] **PairwiseKernel**
  - Added link to `plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py`
  - Shows general usage with custom metrics

- [x] **Matern kernel**
  - Already had link to `plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py`
  - Shows how different Matern parameters affect the GP

- [x] **Exponentiation kernel**
  - Already had link to `plot_gpr_prior_posterior.py`
  - Shows general kernel usage

## Potential Improvements

### Consider adding these links:
- [x] Add link to `plot_gpr_co2.py` in relevant kernel docstrings
  - This example shows time series forecasting with GPs
  - Could be relevant for kernels commonly used in time series:
    - [x] RBF kernel (for long-term trend modeling)
    - [x] ExpSineSquared kernel (for modeling seasonality)
    - [x] RationalQuadratic kernel (for modeling irregularities)
    - [x] WhiteKernel (for modeling noise)
    - [x] Sum kernel (for combining multiple kernel components)
  - **Status**: Added reference to all relevant kernels in the CO2 example.

- [ ] Add link to `plot_gpr_on_structured_data.py` in relevant kernel docstrings
  - This example shows how to use GPs with structured data
  - Demonstrates creation of custom kernels by extending the Kernel base class
  - Could be relevant for:
    - The base Kernel class
    - GenericKernelMixin
  - **Status**: Not yet added.

## Consistency Review
- [ ] Review all kernel docstrings for consistent formatting and wording of example links
- [ ] Ensure links appear in a consistent location in the docstrings
- [ ] Check for any typos or formatting issues in the existing links

## Next Steps
- Complete the review of the remaining example files
- Decide which kernels would benefit from additional example links
- Finalize all changes and prepare for the pull request
